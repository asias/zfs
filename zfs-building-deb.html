<p>Once the <a href="spl-building-deb.html">spl packages are built
and installed</a> you can build the zfs packages using the standard
autoconf style build system.  The zfs build system is designed to detect
and build against your kernel and the spl module.  Simply build it as
you would any other autoconf style project.  The build system will make an
educated guess as to which kernel and version of the spl you wish to build
against.  If it guesses wrong simply specify your kernel devel headers using
the <em>--with-linux</em> configure option.  You may also need the
<em>--with-linux-obj</em> configure option if the kernel build objects
are installed in a different directory.  You can also specify an alternate
version of the spl using the <em>--with-spl</em> and <em>--with-spl-obj</em>

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev uuid-dev libblkid-dev libselinux-dev parted lsscsi
$ ./configure
$ make deb
</pre>

<p>The result of this will be two source rpm packages...  Yes, source rpm
packages.  Currently, deb style packages are built by first creating rpm
packages and then converting them to deb packages using alien.  Long term
we would like to directly create deb packages but it has not been a priority.
If anyone familiar with Debian style packaging would like to help with this
please feel free to contact us.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>zfs-w.x.y-z.src.rpm</em>: Source for the zfs utilities,
	libraries, and test infrastructure.</li>
	<li><em>zfs-modules-w.x.y-z.src.rpm</em>: Source for the zfs
	kernel module stack.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>And five binary deb packages for your platform.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>zfs-w.x.y-z_arch.deb</em>: The zfs utilities
	and libraries.</li>
	<li><em>zfs-devel-w.x.y-z_arch.deb</em>: The zfs
	development headers.</li>
	<li><em>zfs-test-w.x.y-z_arch.deb</em>: The zfs
	regression test scripts and infrastructure.</li>
	<li><em>zfs-modules-w.x.y-z_kernel_arch.deb</em>: The
	zfs kernel module stack for your kernel version.</li>
	<li><em>zfs-modules-devel-w.x.y-z_kernel_arch.deb</em>:
	The zfs development headers and symbols for building dependent
	kernel modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next go ahead and install the packages.</p>

<pre>
$ sudo dpkg -i *_amd64.deb

<p>That&#8217;s it!  You should be able to use the zfs tools just like you
would under Solaris.  If your unfamiliar with zfs I would suggest looking over
the <a href="http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Community+Group+zfs/docs">
official documentation</a> or going through one the many tutorials
available online .  There are also several examples available
<a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>

If you would like to verify the packages you just built you can run the
included <a href="zfs-regression-suite.html">regression test suites</a>.
